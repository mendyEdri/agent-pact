description: "Oracle registration, staking, and capability tracking"
---

The OracleRegistry is a standalone registry for verification oracles. Oracles stake ETH, declare capabilities, and can be challenged and slashed for misbehavior.

<Note>
For most use cases, the **OracleRouter** is preferred over direct oracle registration. The registry is useful for oracles that want to be used directly in pacts without the router.

## Functions

### registerOracle

Register as an oracle with capabilities and stake.

```solidity
function registerOracle(string[] capabilities) external payable
```

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `capabilities` | List of capability strings (e.g., `["code-review", "testing"]`) |
| `msg.value` | Stake amount (must be >= `minStake`) |

### unregisterOracle

Deactivate and withdraw stake.

```solidity
function unregisterOracle() external
```

### challengeOracle

Submit evidence that an oracle has misbehaved.

```solidity
function challengeOracle(address oracle, string evidence) external
```

Increments the oracle's `challengeCount`. The contract owner reviews and decides whether to slash.

### slashOracle

Owner confiscates part of an oracle's stake.

```solidity
function slashOracle(address oracle, uint256 amount) external
```

### incrementVerifications

Track that an oracle completed a verification.

```solidity
function incrementVerifications(address oracle) external
```
