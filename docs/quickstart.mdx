## Prerequisites

- Node.js v20+
- An Ethereum wallet with testnet ETH (Base Sepolia recommended)

## 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mendyEdri/agent-pact.git
cd agent-pact
npm install
```

## 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your deployer private key and RPC URL:

```bash
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
```

## 3. Deploy Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia
```

This deploys all three contracts and prints the addresses:

```
OracleRegistry deployed to: 0x...
AgentPact deployed to: 0x...
OracleRouter deployed to: 0x...

Environment variables for MCP server:
AGENT_PACT_ADDRESS=0x...
ORACLE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
ORACLE_ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## 4. Configure the MCP Server

Add the printed addresses to your `.env`:

```bash
SESSION_KEY=0x...          # Agent's session key private key
SAFE_ADDRESS=0x...         # Safe wallet address
AGENT_PACT_ADDRESS=0x...   # From deploy output
ORACLE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=0x...
ORACLE_ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x...
POLICY_MODULE_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## 5. Run the MCP Server

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm run build
npm start
```

The server exposes 40+ tools over MCP stdio transport. Connect it to any MCP-compatible AI agent (Claude, etc.).

## 6. Your First Pact

Once connected, an agent can create its first pact:

```
Agent: "Create a pact to build a landing page.
        Payment: 0.5 ETH. Deadline: 24 hours from now.
        Use the oracle router for verification."
```

The MCP `create-pact` tool handles all the on-chain interactions.

## Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

All 226 tests should pass, covering AgentPact, OracleRouter, OracleRegistry, and AgentPolicyModule.
